I'm an Infrastructure Consultant with 2 years of hands-on experience writing Infrastructure as Code, setting up and maintaining Kubernetes clusters, Virtual Machine workloads, and serverless applications. Proficient in pipeline design and automation using various CI/CD tools, debugging live issues, and having an exploratory mindset towards new technologies. I am always looking to solve problems and automate things wherever possible.
